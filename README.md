A script interpreter for Game-maker Studio 2 

TO USE: OPEN FILE AND COPY CONTENTS!


Hello! I've put together a simple script runner for gamemaker. Simply run runScriptFile(file) and watch it run! You can also run strings of code rather than files with runScriptAsLine(stringText).

PLEASE NOTE: This is still in development and is UN-FINISHED. I must also note that it may be slow and non-efficient as this is just a test. I will be updating regulary so only use for test projects as of right now.
